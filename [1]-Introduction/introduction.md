What Is Node:

      JavaScript on your backend servers

      The execution of JavaScript on the server is not performed by Node.js but
      a virtual machine VM (V8/Charka)

      Node is the coordinator

      Node is a wrapper for V8

      Node offers asynchronous APIs

Why Node:

      Wrapper around v8(execute JavaScript)

      Built-in modules (fs, http, crypto, zip, ...)

      All modules are for Asynchronous APIs (no threads required)

      C++ addons (first class support for c++)

      You can write addons in JavaScript

      Debugger and other utilities

      NPM - Node Package Manager    

                  - has CLI

                  - commonJS : module reliable package dependency manager


      Node is a platform for tools

      Non-blocking I/O

      reading/writing data over the wire

      Full-Stack: Front-End and Back-End Code


Node NPM:

      npm install cupcake-pan


CallBack:

      Node function that gets called through asynchronous method

      function someFn(data){
            //some code
      }

      callback.someFn(data).whileDoingSomething()

Promise:

      let promise = jQuery.Get("some url")

      promise.then(
            data => console.log('sucess: ' + data),
            error => console.log('error: ' + error)
      )


Is your Node working:

      which npm

      which npx
